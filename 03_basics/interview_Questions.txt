How exactly code execute in JS

JavaScript execution Context := 
    In JavaScript, an execution context is an abstract concept representing the environment in which a piece of JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. It acts as a container for all the necessary information required to run a specific part of the code.

JavaScript Execution Model Notes
I. The Execution Context
Definition: The abstract environment where JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. Understanding this is key to understanding how JS works "under the hood".​

Types of Execution Contexts:

Global Execution Context (GEC): The default context created when a script first runs. It establishes a global object, which in browsers is the window object, and a this variable that refers to it.​

Function Execution Context (FEC): A new context is created every time a function is called. Each function call gets its own context, separate from the global one.​

II. Two Phases of Execution
Every execution context is created in two phases:​

1. Memory Creation Phase:

The JavaScript engine scans the code and allocates memory for all variables and functions.​

Variables declared with var are initialized with a placeholder value of undefined.​

Function declarations are stored in memory in their entirety.​

2. Execution Phase:

The engine executes the code line by line.​

Variables are assigned their actual values.​

When a function is called, a new function execution context is created and the two-phase process repeats for that function.​

III. The Call Stack

Purpose: To manage and keep track of all the execution contexts created during the code's execution.​

LIFO Principle: It operates on a "Last-In, First-Out" (LIFO) basis. The last function to be called is the first one to be completed and removed (popped) from the stack.​

Process Flow:

The Global Execution Context is the first item pushed onto the stack and forms its base.​

Each time a function is called, its new execution context is pushed onto the top of the stack.​

When a function finishes executing (i.e., hits a return statement or the end of its code), its context is popped off the top of the stack.​

This process continues until the stack is empty, which happens after the global code is finished

Types of Execution Contexts:

Global Execution Context: This is the default or base context that is created when a JavaScript script first starts. It is associated with a global object, which in browsers is the window object.​

Function Execution Context: A new execution context is created every time a function is called.​

Phases of Execution: JavaScript code is run in two phases: the Memory Creation Phase and the Execution Phase.
